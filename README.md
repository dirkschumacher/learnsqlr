# learnsqlr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of learnsqlr is to provide an RStudio addin to practice SQL.

Currently all hacked together to test the idea and get feedback.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("dirkschumacher/leansqlr")
```

## Example

Start the SQL learner either using `learnsqlr::learnsqlr_rstudio()` or using
the addin selection box.
